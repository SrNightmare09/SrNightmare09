### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

>I'm SrNightmare09, a passionate, self-taught programmer. I enjoy coding a lot because of the fact that you can do literally anything without any barriers. Coding also taught me how to look at a thing from different perspectives; that you always have two ways of finding a solution - the hard way and the smart way
>
>Even though I have been programming for around 4 years, I never really considered using Github until I realized how super-duper helpful it is for a programmer.
