### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

>I'm SrNightmare09. I enjoy coding a lot because of the fact that you can do anything literally in it without any barriers. Coding also tought me how to look at a thing from different perspectives, that you always have two ways of finding a solution - The smart way and the hard way.

 My Github stats may not be exaclty 'appealing', but trust me, I've got the experience :^)
